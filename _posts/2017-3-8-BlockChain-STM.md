title: The Smart Contract and Transactional Memory Analogy
---

In this post and the coming ones I will be detailing about a particularly interesting analogy between Smart Contracts and Transactional memory. And how we can use one to verify and reason about the other. The majority of this work has been driven by the [paper by Dr. Ilya Sergey and Dr. Aquinas Hobor](http://ilyasergey.net/papers/csc-wtsc17.pdf) on similar grounds. My attempt has been to try and extend the ideas from this paper, to mitigate the issues plaguing Smart contracts and their semantics as listed in another paper on [Making Smart Contracts Smarter](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/633.pdf). Essentially this serves as a literature survey as well as a playground for me to pitch my ideas unifying the 2 papers. Sounds rad? Then read ahead. :)

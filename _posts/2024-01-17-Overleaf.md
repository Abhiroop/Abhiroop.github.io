title: Overleaf submission to arXiV
---

After scouring through the entire web for close to 5 years and giving up out of sheer frustration every time, I was finally able to upload my TeX sources to arXiv (as of 17.01.2024). The solution was buried as a comment to one of the lesser upvoted answers in a less popular StackExchange thread. I hope Google will push this post high up so that it can help Overleaf (and `minted`) users.

1. Compile with `\usepackage[finalizecache,cachedir=.]{minted}`
2. Go to logs and output files > other logs and files and download everything with pyg. (all the `*.pygtex` and the `*.pygfile`)
3. Compile now with `\usepackage[frozencache,cachedir=.]{minted}`
4. Download the complete project `.zip` by submitting it to arXiV
5. Unzip and put all the `*.pygtex` files and the `*.pygfile` into the folder
6. Zip again and upload to arXiv; Works for me!

title: 20 Films That Inspire Teach and Move
---

Inspired by Satyajit Ray's [Deep Focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13385130-deep-focus)—a compulsory reading at FTII Pune and NSD Delhi—I was struck by the nuances with which Ray breaks down his favourite films and directors. This led me to finally compile a list of my own 10 (+10) favourite films. However, I soon realised that rather than ranking them purely on cinematic merit, my choices were more personal—a reflection of the life lessons they offer.

Some of my favourite films, like Pulp Fiction or any Christopher Nolan film, don’t necessarily impart a life lesson—nor is it the director’s duty to teach one. But in the end, I felt compelled to share this list anyway. Below, I’ve written a few lines about what drew me to these works. To the reader, I can assure you that each of these films will be a moving experience if you take the time to watch them—and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

### 1. 12 Angry Men (USA)

Surprisingly, the easiest pick for me was number one. From the moment I began this list, I knew that the 1957 film 12 Angry Men was perhaps the greatest cinematic masterpiece I had ever witnessed. The film casts a sharp eye on the justice system, exploring its fragility and biases.

A phrase that originated in the legal system and has since become a mainstay in everyday conversation—"*beyond reasonable doubt*"—is central to the film. 12 Angry Men takes the concept of "reasonable doubt" and turns it on its head, exposing how deeply personal prejudices shape our judgment, often influenced by the social strata we belong to. It challenges us to question our assumptions and remain wary of absolute truths in society.

At its core, the film is also a sobering reflection on how our justice system hangs by a thread—a thread held by the jury. Their decisions, often swayed by personal moods or circumstances, can mean the difference between life and death for a defendant.

### 2. Incendies (Canada)

To this day, the climax of Incendies gives me goosebumps. Based on Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, this screen adaptation weaves a non-linear narrative around the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 and its profound impact on Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada.

As Nawal's children uncover her past, piecing together the fragments of her life, we come face to face with the harsh realities of war—the suffering of ordinary people, the role of women in society, honor killings, and other deeply powerful themes. The film has often been compared to Greek tragedies, and its climax remains one of my all-time favorites. It is the kind of ending that compels you to sit in silence, reflecting on what you have just witnessed.

A younger me would probably find it unbelievable that I would not rank a single Tarantino film (of whom I am a huge fan) or Nolan's work ahead of a straight ahead *masala* blockbuster like Rang De Basanti or a children film like Iron Giant. The film critic in me is probably dying that there is no Malyalam or Marathi theater work in the list but I think I am not dismissing these as bad movies. Its just there is so much to learn from each of these 20 movies. A movie like Pulp Fiction stands up and says there is nothing to teach but is just a straight up story (as the name suggests), and is the epitome of a good film, but I think the idealist in me and the young child still

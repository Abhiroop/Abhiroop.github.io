title: 20 Films That Inspire, Teach and Move
---

Inspired by Satyajit Ray's [Deep Focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13385130-deep-focus)—a compulsory reading at FTII Pune and NSD Delhi—I was struck by the nuances with which Ray breaks down his favourite films and directors. This led me to finally compile a list of my own 10 (+10) favourite films. However, I soon realised that rather than ranking them purely on cinematic merit, my choices were more personal—a reflection of the life lessons they offer.

Some of my favourite films, like Pulp Fiction or any Christopher Nolan film, don’t necessarily impart a life lesson—nor is it the director’s duty to teach one. But in the end, I felt compelled to share this list anyway. Below, I’ve written a few lines about what drew me to these works. To the reader, I can assure you that each of these films will be a moving experience if you take the time to watch them—and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

### 1. 12 Angry Men (USA)

Surprisingly, the easiest pick for me was number one. From the moment I began this list, I knew that the 1957 film 12 Angry Men was perhaps the greatest cinematic masterpiece I had ever witnessed. The film casts a sharp eye on the justice system, exploring its fragility and biases.

A phrase that originated in the legal system and has since become a mainstay in everyday conversation—"*beyond reasonable doubt*"—is central to the film. 12 Angry Men takes the concept of "reasonable doubt" and turns it on its head, exposing how deeply personal prejudices shape our judgment, often influenced by the social strata we belong to. It challenges us to question our assumptions and remain wary of absolute truths in society.

At its core, the film is also a sobering reflection on how our justice system hangs by a thread—a thread held by the jury. Their decisions, often swayed by personal moods or circumstances, can mean the difference between life and death for a defendant.

### 2. Incendies (Canada)

To this day, the climax of Incendies gives me goosebumps. Based on Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, this screen adaptation weaves a non-linear narrative around the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 and its profound impact on Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada.

As Nawal's children uncover her past, piecing together the fragments of her life, we come face to face with the harsh realities of war—the suffering of ordinary people, the state of women in a war-torn society, honor killings, and other deeply powerful themes. The film has often been compared to Greek tragedies, and its climax remains one of my all-time favorites. It is the kind of ending that compels you to sit in silence, reflecting on what you have just witnessed.

### 3. Aamis (India)

Aamis (English: Ravening) is probably the only non-commercial, slightly artsy film on this list. This ingenious hidden gem takes a seemingly simple concept—the food we eat—something innocuous and uncontroversial, and pushes it to an extreme that challenges our fundamental beliefs. To what degree do we pursue hedonism without realizing how far we are pushing the boundaries of what we consider normal?

At the same time, Aamis is one of the few Indian films that shines a light on the often-overlooked region of Northeast India and its food traditions. However, does its imagery reinforce binary stereotypes? I came across this critique in a [social-theory paper on Aamis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14746689.2022.2089462?tab=permissions&scroll=top). Regardless, this film is so thought-provoking that it will undoubtedly leave you reflecting on your own belief systems.

### 4. Whiplash (USA)

Whiplash explores a complex and fascinating topic—the relentless pursuit of perfection and the lengths one will go to achieve it. Set in a fictionalised version of the legendary Juilliard Music School, New York, the film follows a ruthless teacher (J.K. Simmons) who pushes his students to their limits in pursuit of excellence.

While this list focuses on broader themes rather than individual performances, Simmons' gives a performance of a lifetime as a perfectionist jazz teacher. The film delivers a crucial message: perfection comes at a cost. It breaks you in ways unimaginable at the start, but the view from that mythical peak is one most of us can only dream of—and in the climax, the film gives us a small taste of it.

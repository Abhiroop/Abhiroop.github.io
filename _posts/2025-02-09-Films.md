title: 20 Films That Inspire, Teach and Move
---

Inspired by Satyajit Ray's [Deep Focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13385130-deep-focus)—a compulsory reading at FTII Pune and NSD Delhi—I was struck by the depth and nuance with which Ray analyses his favourite films and directors. This led me to finally compile a list of my own 10 (+10) favourite films. However, I soon realised that rather than ranking them purely on cinematic merit, my choices were more personal—a reflection of the life lessons they offer.

Some of my favourite films, like Pulp Fiction or any Christopher Nolan film, don’t necessarily impart a life lesson—nor is it the director’s duty to teach one. But in the end, I felt compelled to share this list anyway. Below, I’ve written a few lines about what drew me to these works. To the reader, I can assure you that each of these films will be a moving experience if you take the time to watch them—and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

### 1. 12 Angry Men (USA)

Surprisingly, the easiest pick for me was number one. From the moment I began this list, I knew that the 1957 film 12 Angry Men was perhaps the greatest cinematic masterpiece I had ever witnessed. The film casts a sharp eye on the justice system, exploring its fragility and biases.

A phrase that originated in the legal system and has since become a mainstay in everyday conversation—"*beyond reasonable doubt*"—is central to the film. 12 Angry Men takes the concept of "reasonable doubt" and turns it on its head, exposing how deeply personal prejudices shape our judgment, often influenced by the social strata we belong to. It challenges us to question our assumptions and remain wary of absolute truths in society.

At its core, the film is also a sobering reflection on how our justice system hangs by a thread—a thread held by the jury. Their decisions, often swayed by personal moods or circumstances, can mean the difference between life and death for a defendant.

### 2. Incendies (Canada)

To this day, the climax of Incendies gives me goosebumps. Based on Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, this screen adaptation weaves a non-linear narrative around the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 and its profound impact on Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada.

As Nawal's children uncover her past, piecing together the fragments of her life, we come face to face with the harsh realities of war—the suffering of ordinary people, the state of women in a war-torn society, honor killings, and other deeply powerful themes. The film has often been compared to Greek tragedies, and its climax remains one of my all-time favorites. It is the kind of ending that compels you to sit in silence, reflecting on what you have just witnessed.

### 3. Aamis (India)

<img src="/images/Aamis.jpg" alt="Aamis" width="300" height="500">

Aamis (English: Ravening) is probably the only non-commercial, slightly artsy film on this list. This ingenious hidden gem takes a seemingly simple concept—the food we eat—something innocuous and uncontroversial, and pushes it to an extreme that challenges our fundamental beliefs. To what degree do we pursue hedonism without realizing how far we are pushing the boundaries of what we consider normal?

At the same time, Aamis is one of the few Indian films that shines a light on the often-overlooked region of Northeast India and its food traditions. However, does its imagery reinforce binary stereotypes? I came across this critique in a [social-theory paper on Aamis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14746689.2022.2089462?tab=permissions&scroll=top). Regardless, this film is so thought-provoking that it will undoubtedly leave you reflecting on your own belief systems.

### 4. Whiplash (USA)

Whiplash explores a complex and fascinating topic—the relentless pursuit of perfection and the lengths one will go to achieve it. Set in a fictionalised version of the legendary Juilliard Music School, New York, the film follows a ruthless teacher (J.K. Simmons) who pushes his students to their limits in pursuit of excellence.

While this list focuses on broader themes rather than individual performances, Simmons gives a performance of a lifetime as a perfectionist jazz teacher. The film delivers a crucial message: perfection comes at a cost. It breaks you in ways unimaginable at the start, but the view from that mythical peak is one most of us can only dream of—and in the climax, the film gives us a small taste of it.

### 5. Princess Mononoke (Japan)

And finally, we arrive at a Studio Ghibli film. Miyazaki’s movies are literal works of art, with every frame painstakingly hand-drawn by animators. Princess Mononoke stands as a testament to Hollywood and the world at large on the power of strong female leads and leadership. The film evokes nostalgia for pre-industrial Japan—a time of harmony between people and nature—while serving as a stark reminder of how the relentless march of industrialisation has left us increasingly desolate and disconnected.

Beyond the eponymous Princess Mononoke, the character of Lady Eboshi is perhaps my favourite grey character in any film. She is strong and independent, offering refuge to society’s outcasts—former prostitutes and people with leprosy—yet she is also the ruthless leader of Irontown. Her character serves as a reminder of the difficult balance a just leader must strike in times of conflict.

Every scene in this film feels like a stroll through an art gallery—an absolute masterpiece and a true delight to watch!

### 6. Mother (Korea)

<img src="/images/Mother.jpg" alt="Mother" width="300" height="500">

We arrive at Bong Joon-ho, who, in my opinion, is one of the greatest living directors. Mother is an oft-overlooked masterpiece that I personally consider his best. It is also one of his more complex films, layered with multiple underlying themes. At its core, it portrays a disconnected society—one where the murdered body of a young girl lies in broad daylight, yet, because of her social status, no one looks closely or intervenes.

As the title suggests, the film is ultimately about a mother’s love—the lengths to which she will go to protect and care for her child. It also sheds light on the bullying and mistreatment children endure in their daily lives. However, in classic Bong Joon-ho fashion, these plot threads are twisted in unexpected ways, culminating in a devastating climax.

By the end, you are left conflicted, confronting one of my favourite themes: what is truth? Are we truly seeing it, or are we merely looking through a blurred window?

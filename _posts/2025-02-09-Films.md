title: 20 Films That Inspire, Teach and Move
---

Inspired by Satyajit Ray's [Deep Focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13385130-deep-focus)—a compulsory reading at FTII Pune and NSD Delhi—I was struck by the depth and nuance with which Ray analyses his favourite films and directors. This led me to finally compile a list of my own 10 (+10) favourite films. However, I soon realised that rather than ranking them purely on cinematic merit, my choices were more personal—a reflection of the life lessons they offer.

Some of my favourite films, like Pulp Fiction or any Christopher Nolan film, don’t necessarily impart a life lesson—nor is it the director’s duty to teach one. But in the end, I felt compelled to share this list anyway. Below, I’ve written a few lines about what drew me to these works. To the reader, I can assure you that each of these films will be a moving experience if you take the time to watch them—and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

### 1. 12 Angry Men (USA)

<img src="/images/12_Angry_Men.jpg" alt="12 Angry Men" width="300" height="500">

Surprisingly, the easiest pick for me was number one. From the moment I began this list, I knew that the 1957 film - 12 Angry Men undeniably belonged atleast in the top three. The film casts a sharp eye on the justice system, exploring its fragility and biases.

A phrase that originated in the legal system and has since become a mainstay in everyday conversation—"*beyond reasonable doubt*"—is central to the film. 12 Angry Men takes the concept of "reasonable doubt" and turns it on its head, exposing how deeply personal prejudices shape our judgment, often influenced by the social strata we belong to. It challenges us to question our assumptions and remain wary of absolute truths in society.

At its core, the film is also a sobering reflection on how our justice system hangs by a thread—a thread held by the jury. Their decisions, often swayed by personal moods or circumstances, can mean the difference between life and death for a defendant.

### 2. Incendies (Canada)

<img src="/images/Incendies.jpg" alt="Incendies" width="300" height="500">

To this day, the climax of Incendies gives me goosebumps. Based on Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, this screen adaptation weaves a non-linear narrative around the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 and its profound impact on Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada.

As Nawal's children uncover her past, piecing together the fragments of her life, we come face to face with the harsh realities of war—the suffering of ordinary people, the state of women in a war-torn society, honor killings, and other deeply powerful themes. The film has often been compared to Greek tragedies, and its climax remains one of my all-time favorites. It is the kind of ending that compels you to sit in silence, reflecting on what you have just witnessed.

**Keyword: Anti-war**

### 3. Aamis (India)

<img src="/images/Aamis.jpg" alt="Aamis" width="300" height="500">

Aamis (English: Ravening) is probably the only non-commercial, slightly artsy film on this list. This ingenious hidden gem takes a seemingly simple concept—the food we eat—something innocuous and uncontroversial, and pushes it to an extreme that challenges our fundamental beliefs. To what degree do we pursue hedonism without realizing how far we are pushing the boundaries of what we consider normal?

At the same time, Aamis is one of the few Indian films that shines a light on the often-overlooked region of Northeast India and its food traditions. However, does its imagery reinforce binary stereotypes? I came across this critique in a [social-theory paper on Aamis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14746689.2022.2089462?tab=permissions&scroll=top). Regardless, this film is so thought-provoking that it will undoubtedly leave you reflecting on your own belief systems.

**Keywords: Food Habits, Belief system, Hedonism, Prejudice**

### 4. Whiplash (USA)

<img src="/images/Whiplash.jpg" alt="Whiplash" width="300" height="500">

Whiplash explores a complex and fascinating topic—the relentless pursuit of perfection and the lengths one will go to achieve it. Set in a fictionalised version of the legendary Juilliard Music School, New York, the film follows a ruthless teacher (J.K. Simmons) who pushes his students to their limits in pursuit of excellence.

While this list focuses on broader themes rather than individual performances, Simmons gives a performance of a lifetime as a perfectionist jazz teacher. The film delivers a crucial message: perfection comes at a cost. It breaks you in ways unimaginable at the start, but the view from that mythical peak is one most of us can only dream of—and in the climax, the film gives us a small taste of it.

**Keywords: Perfection, Excellence, Toxic Relations, Teacher**

### 5. Princess Mononoke (Japan)

<img src="/images/Mononoke.jpg" alt="Mononoke" width="400" height="500">

And finally, we arrive at a Studio Ghibli film. Miyazaki’s movies are literal works of art, with every frame painstakingly hand-drawn by animators. Princess Mononoke stands as a testament to Hollywood and the world at large on the power of strong female leads and leadership. The film evokes nostalgia for pre-industrial Japan—a time of harmony between people and nature—while serving as a stark reminder of how the relentless march of industrialisation has left us increasingly desolate and disconnected.

Beyond the eponymous Princess Mononoke, the character of Lady Eboshi is perhaps my favourite grey character in any film. She is strong and independent, offering refuge to society’s outcasts—former prostitutes and people with leprosy—yet she is also the ruthless leader of Irontown. Her character serves as a reminder of the difficult balance a just leader must strike in times of conflict.

Every scene in this film feels like a stroll through an art gallery—an absolute masterpiece and a true delight to watch!

**Keywords: Nature, Greed, Pacifism, Industrialisation**

### 6. Mother (Korea)

<img src="/images/Mother.jpg" alt="Mother" width="325" height="500">

We arrive at Bong Joon-ho, who, in my opinion, is one of the greatest living directors. Mother is an oft-overlooked masterpiece that I personally consider his best. It is also one of his more complex films, layered with multiple underlying themes. At its core, it portrays a disconnected society—one where the murdered body of a young girl lies in broad daylight, yet, because of her social status, no one looks closely or intervenes.

As the title suggests, the film is ultimately about a mother’s love—the lengths to which she will go to protect and care for her child. It also sheds light on the bullying and mistreatment children endure in their daily lives. However, in classic Bong Joon-ho fashion, these plot threads are twisted in unexpected ways, culminating in a devastating climax.

By the end, you are left conflicted, confronting one of my favourite themes: what is truth? Are we truly seeing it, or are we merely looking through a blurred window?

**Keywords: Truth, Mother, Disconnected society, Single Parenthood, Blind Love**

### 7. Spirited Away (Japan)

<img src="/images/SpiritedAway.jpg" alt="Spirited Away" width="350" height="500">

Widely regarded as Miyazaki's masterpiece and the film that introduced many Western audiences to the magic of Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away is a work of unparalleled beauty. Its themes are too numerous to outline fully, but for me, the most striking is the innocence of childhood. Even today, when I watch Spirited Away, I find myself connecting with Chihiro—her mixture of awe and fear as she navigates an unfamiliar world resonates deeply.

The film powerfully explores separation anxiety and the pain of losing loved ones. In fact, the more I reflect on it, Spirited Away feels like a modern existentialist work. It aligns with Sartre’s notion that "existence precedes essence"—a lifelong struggle to define who we are. Yet, unlike the bleak conclusions of some French existentialists, Miyazaki offers a more hopeful vision. He shows that friendship, courage, and kindness can help us navigate even the most unfathomable worlds. Above all, the film reminds us of the importance of treating every life form with compassion.

If you haven't yet watched Spirited Away, I can only say—I envy you. You have the rare joy of discovering this masterpiece for the first time. And of course, I can’t resist sharing the iconic train scene:

### 8. Up (USA)

<img src="/images/Up.jpg" alt="Up" width="300" height="500">

Of course, no list of moving films would be complete without a Pixar entry. Among Pixar’s many inspiring works, I personally consider Up the best (sorry, Wall-E and others!).

Although marketed as a children’s film, Up tackles profound and often painful themes right from the start. Within its opening moments, it addresses the struggles of a couple facing fertility challenges, followed shortly by the devastating loss of a partner and the heartbreak that follows. The short montage Married Life has already achieved cult status as a cinematic masterpiece—and incredibly, this is just the beginning of the film!

The rest of Up lives up to that emotional depth, exploring the disillusionment that comes from meeting our childhood heroes and realising their fallibility. Along the way, the characters, through kindness, loyalty, courage, and wit, learn one of life’s most powerful lessons: the importance of letting go. The film delivers one of the most poignant depictions of this theme, reminding us that it is never too late to embrace new adventures. It brings to mind the saying, "You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore."

### 9. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missourie (USA)

<img src="/images/3Billboards.jpg" alt="3 Billboards" width="300" height="500">

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri powerfully explores the theme of navigating rage. At its core, the film follows two unlikely companions on a shared journey—Frances McDormand’s and Sam Rockwell’s characters—both grappling with the loss of loved ones. One has lost her daughter, while the other lost his father at a young age. The film subtly reveals how these tragedies have transformed them into figures consumed by anger, resentful of the unfair hand they believe the world has dealt them. Yet, over time, they both come to understand the profound power of forgiveness and the peace it can bring.

Sam Rockwell’s character arc is one of the most compelling anti-hero transformations I’ve ever seen. A particularly moving moment is the series of letters from Chief Willoughby, in which he asks for forgiveness—not just for himself, but as an appeal for others to embrace forgiveness and find inner peace.

Another central theme is the elusive nature of justice. As Willoughby profoundly reflects in one of his letters: "What you need to become a detective is love. Because through love comes calm, and through calm comes thought. And you need thought to detect stuff sometimes..." With stellar performances and a powerful narrative, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri stays with you long after the credits roll.

**Keywords: Forgiveness, Love, Kindness, Justice, Rage**

### 10. The Wailing (Korea)

<img src="/images/The_Wailing.jpg" alt="The Wailing" width="300" height="500">

Another Korean masterpiece, The Wailing evokes horror without relying on jump scares or other traditional horror tropes. It is a richly layered film, filled with subliminal messages so intricate that capturing them all is nearly impossible. Themes such as the generational divide, the struggle between tradition and modernity, xenophobia, and the tension between Christianity and traditional Korean and Japanese shamanism run deep throughout the story.

At its core, the film explores how mistrust within an isolated community—fueled by prejudice—can lead to societal collapse, ultimately allowing a symbolic *Satan* to take hold. Even years after its release, audiences continue to analyse its The Wailing's symbolism, debate its ambiguous climax, and grapple with the question of who is truly good or evil. I highly recommend checking out multiple analyses of the film—it’s a mystery that keeps unfolding with every rewatch.

**Keywords: Superstition, Mistrust**

### 11. Tumbbad (India)

<img src="/images/Tumbbad.jpg" alt="Tumbbad" width="325" height="500">

In a single sentence, Tumbbad is the ultimate personification of greed. And in 2025, as we witness those in power shaping policies under the guise of good intentions and the greater good, Tumbbad lays bare what truly lurks beneath the surface. It’s unlikely that any follow-up film could so vividly capture and embody the essence of greed and its transformative grip on a person.

**Keyword: Greed**

### 12. Parasite (Korea)

<img src="/images/Parasite.jpg" alt="Parasite" width="325" height="500">

The first and only non-English film to win an Oscar for Best Picture, Parasite is perhaps Bong Joon-Ho's most well-known film in recent years. Much has already been said and written about this masterpiece, where nearly every scene serves as a symbol of economic disparity between the wealthy and the working class in Korea. For one family, the rain is a beautiful spectacle; for another, it brings devastation as they struggle to save their home. The film masterfully portrays this divide through its literal uptown-downtown contrast. Parasite is probably the most commercial and easily accessible film on this list.

### 13. Swades (India)

<img src="/images/Swades.jpg" alt="Swades" width="325" height="500">


Swades is perhaps the most personal film on this list. I don’t think I can do justice to everything it represents in just a few lines—perhaps a full blog post or even an academic paper would be more fitting. Beyond being an emotional journey into the heartland of India, Swades is also a cinematically brilliant film.

Mohan (an allusion to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) and Kaveri Ammi (symbolic of the river Cauvery) have long been separated, yet his inner guilt and sense of duty pull him back to her village. Most intriguingly, the film presents two versions of Mohan. When he first arrives, he is not the typical caricature of an NRI disconnected from India. He knows the country well—its Constitution, its major rivers, its politics, its corruption, its strengths, and its flaws. I personally related the most to this version of him. But then something happens, and we see a transformation. This time, Mohan doesn’t just *know*—he *understands*. He witnesses firsthand the inequality and systemic casteism tearing India apart and realises that to make a difference, he must be much more than who he was when he arrived.

It’s the difference between knowledge and wisdom, much like the one Hermann Hesse speaks about in [Siddhartha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52036.Siddhartha). I highly recommend watching this film—but preferably under my supervision, so I can relentlessly comment on every frame and dissect every hidden meaning along the way :) .

### 14. The Shawshank Redemption (USA)

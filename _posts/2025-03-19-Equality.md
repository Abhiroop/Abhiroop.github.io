title: On Equality
---

One of the most fundamental notions in type theory is equality. There are various forms of equality, including [propositional equality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/equality#propositional_equality), [judgmental equality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/equality#judgmental_equality), [typal equality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/equality#typal_equality), [extensional equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensionality), [intensional equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intension), [path equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory#Equality) (a key concept in homotopy type theory), among others. The list goes on, and any deep exploration of the concept of equality could easily expand to book length. Instead of attempting to cover all these notions at once, I believe it’s best to build this blog post incrementally.


Martin-Löf Equality
-------------------

The Swedish logician [Per Martin-Löf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Martin-L%C3%B6f) pretty much introduced the notion of [*dependent typing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) to the world. Every theorem prover/proof assistant in existence owes its origin to Martin-Löf's seminal work.

A key concept in his type theory is what we call *Martin-Löf equality*, a dependent type that takes a fixed term `x : A` and maps any term `y : A` to the type $`x \equiv y`$. I will be using Agda in this blog post. The equality definition in Agda looks like the following:

```agda
data _≡_ {A : Set} (x : A) : A → Set where
  refl : x ≡ x
```

The `{A : Set}` is a type parameter, meaning the equality type is polymorphic over any type `A` in the universe `Set`. `refl : x ≡ x` is the sole constructor of the equality type. It states that the only way to construct a proof of equality is by showing that a term is equal to itself (reflexivity).

I write code in Haskell and Clojure. Sometimes I write Erlang as a hobby. I like types and program analysis! In a past life I used to write a lot of Java and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JVM and its GC mechanisms. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about lazy languages, monads, type systems, DSLs, macros,distributed systems and more!

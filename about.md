I write code in Haskell and Clojure. Sometimes I try Erlang, but I have read about it a lot more than I have ever written. I like types and program analysis! In a past life I used to write a lot of Java and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JVM and its GC mechanisms. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about lazy languages, monads, type systems, DSLs, macros and more

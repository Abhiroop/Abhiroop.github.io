I am currently pursuing my PhD at Chalmers University working on the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project. I majorly program in Haskell and C. My current research themes revolve around programming languages, compilers, hardware and embedded systems. I used to hack on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). I am currently designing a functional programming language for programming heavily memory constrained devices (anything less than an MB). In a past life I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about functional programming, type systems, compilers, embedded systems, distributed systems and more!

### Standing Invitation

Inspired by [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) and [Lars Hupel](https://lars.hupel.info/about/) I am offering a standing invitation: *If you want to talk about research or software (or hardware), I want to talk to you.* [Contact me.](mailto:sarkara@chalmers.se)

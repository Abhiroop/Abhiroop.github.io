I am a fourth-year PhD student at Chalmers University. I work on the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project.

My work concerns embedded systems and their security. I am currently the lead designer of the [SynchronVM project](https://github.com/SynchronVM/SynchronVM). 

Topic-wise, I am broadly interested in the following in no particular order :

- Compilers
- Virtual Machines
- Concurrency
- Computer Architecture (specifically Microarchitectural Security)
- Memory Management

I sporadically read about philosophy. I often contemplate the role of *time* and *asynchrony* in programming languages, natural languages, music, and the wider physical world. You can find my occasional [book reviews on Goodreads](https://abhiroop.github.io/books/).

<!-- I majorly program in Haskell and C. I hacked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to add support for vector instruction for my Masters. In a past life, I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms.  -->

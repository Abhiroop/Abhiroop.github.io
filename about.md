I am currently pursuing my PhD at Chalmers University working on the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project. I am a Haskell programmer. I research on programming languages, compilers and parallel programming. I mostly hack on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). In a past life I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about functional programming, lazy languages, type systems, compilers, parallel programming, distributed systems and more!

### Standing Invitation

Inspired by [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) and [Lars Hupel](https://lars.hupel.info/about/) I am offering a standing invitation: *If you want to talk about research or software (or hardware), I want to talk to you.* [Contact me.](mailto:sarkara@chalmers.se)

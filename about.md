I am a third year PhD student at Chalmers University. I work on the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project. 

I am currently thinking about how **asynchrony** manifests itself in programming languages, natural languages and the physical world in general. 

As a consequence of the above I am searching for ways to **structure asynchrony** into a general language and runtime framework. My experiment testbed is centered around low-powered, memory-constrained IoT applications which makes the challenge all the more harder but much more interesting!

Topic-wise I am broadly interested in the following in no particular order :

- Compilers
- Virtual Machines
- Concurrency
- Computer Architecture
- Type systems
- Static Analysis


<!-- I majorly program in Haskell and C. I hacked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to add support for vector instruction for my Masters. In a past life, I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms.  -->

### Standing Invitation

Inspired by [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) and [Lars Hupel](https://lars.hupel.info/about/) I am offering a standing invitation: *If you want to talk about research or software (or hardware), I want to talk to you.* [Contact me.](mailto:sarkara@chalmers.se)

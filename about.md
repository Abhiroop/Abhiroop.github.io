I am a second year PhD student at Chalmers University. I work on the [Octopi](https://octopi.chalmers.se) project. I am currently in the process of designing a purely functional programming language for programming heavily memory constrained devices (anything less than 10 MB). I am interested in the following topics in no particular order:

- Compilers
- Type systems
- Static Analysis
- Computer Architecture
- Concurrency

I majorly program in Haskell and C. I hacked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to add support for vector instruction for my Masters.  In a past life, I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms. 

### Standing Invitation

Inspired by [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) and [Lars Hupel](https://lars.hupel.info/about/) I am offering a standing invitation: *If you want to talk about research or software (or hardware), I want to talk to you.* [Contact me.](mailto:sarkara@chalmers.se)

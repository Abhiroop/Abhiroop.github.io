I am a Haskell programmer. I research on programming languages, compilers and parallel programming. I work with Haskell and other functional languages like Clojure and Erlang. In a past life I used to write lots of Java and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JVM and its GC mechanisms. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about functional programming, lazy languages, type systems, compilers, parallel programming, distributed systems and more!

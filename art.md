Recently, while watching the phenomenal comedic TV series - Parks and Recreation, I came across a rather funny but thoughtful segment on art. In that episode, the character Tom Haverford (played by Aziz Ansari), known for his "cool guy" persona—someone who would never picture himself quietly appreciating art—unexpectedly falls in love with [abstract expressionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism) art through a series of events.

Unlike Tom, I have always been fascinated by art and painting, though I have never had the time to pursue it seriously. Now, I have finally decided to consciously carve out time to explore my love for sketching, [political cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_cartoon), street and [guerrilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_art) art, [Indian folk and tribal art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_art#Folk_and_tribal_art), and [*Escheresque* art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher). Here, I present my amateur attempts at learning some of these beautiful art forms, collected in no particular order:

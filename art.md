Recently, while watching the phenomenal comedic TV series - Parks and Recreation, I came across a rather funny but thoughtful segment on art. In that episode, the character of Tom Haverford (played by Aziz Ansari), who typically has this "cool guy" persona and someone who would never for the life of him imagine sitting in a room and appreciating art, through a sequence of events ending up falling in love with [abstract expressionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism) art.

Unlike Tom, I have always been fascinated by art and painting but have never had the time to pursue it seriously. Finally, I have decided to consciously carve out some time to pursue my love for sketching, [political cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_cartoon), street and [guerrilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_art) art, [Indian folk and tribal art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_art#Folk_and_tribal_art), and [*Escheresque* art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher). Here, I present my amateur attempts at learning some of these beautiful art forms, collected chronologically.

After nearly a 15 years hiatus, I have once again (Thanks to the pandemic) picked up my old hobby of reading! I decided to write my reviews, which will highlight what I immediately felt after completing that book, on Goodreads. For you, weary wanderer of the Internet realm, here are my reviews (latest first):

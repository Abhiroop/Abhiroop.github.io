<p>I am a fifth-year PhD student at Chalmers University. I am part of the <a href="https://octopi.chalmers.se">Octopi</a> project.</p>

<p>My work concerns embedded systems and their security. I am currently the lead designer of the <a href="https://github.com/SynchronVM/SynchronVM">SynchronVM project</a>.</p>

<p>Topic-wise, I am broadly interested in the following in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All aspects of programming language implementation - compilers, runtimes, memory management, type systems, etc. </li>
  <li>Concurrency and Parallelism </li>
  <li>Certified Programming with theorem provers such as Coq </li>
  <li>Operating Systems and their Security </li>
  <li>Computer Architecture (specifically Microarchitectural Security)</li>
  
</ul>

<p>I sporadically read about logic and philosophy. 
	I am currently contemplating the formal definition of <em>trust</em> and ways to design computer systems that uphold the various dimensions of trust, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. </p>
	
	<!-- contemplate the role of <em>time</em> and <em>asynchrony</em> in programming languages, natural languages, music, and the wider physical world. </p> -->

<!-- I majorly program in Haskell and C. I hacked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to add support for vector instruction for my Masters. In a past life, I used to be a JVM aficionado and ended up knowing some dark secrets about the JLS and the JVM GC mechanisms.  --></p>

#### Popular Science Summary

The growing adoption of software in every aspect of modern society, while enhancing productivity,
has also opened up a lucrative attack surface for malicious actors to cause widescale societal
damage. This stems from the fundamental design of our software stacks, which are constructed as a
*trusted* tower of abstractions involving complex low-level software such as hypervisors, operating
systems, firmware, drivers, etc. Attackers exploit a programmer's *trust* in these bloated low-level
software stacks to execute sophisticated attacks, compromising the safety and security of software
running on the cloud and in embedded environments.

This dissertation addresses the fundamental issue of *trust* in software through a domain-specific
functional programming language. The language employs a combination of specialised hardware
isolation technologies and cryptographic techniques to eliminate the tower of low-level software
abstractions from the programmer's *trusted code base*, enabling software construction tailored for
malicious cloud environments. Furthermore, in the realm of embedded systems, we introduce a
high-level functional programming language and runtime, elevating the abstraction level at which
these systems are programmed and significantly reducing common *memory, type, and temporal-
unsafety* vulnerabilities. We hope that the contributions made through our dissertation will pave the
way for further research avenues, where the robust security guarantees provided by our proposed
functional languages can be integrated with emerging hardware and software-based security
techniques to enable the construction of safer and more secure digital systems.
